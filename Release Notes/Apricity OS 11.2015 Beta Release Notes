The Apricity OS Team is very excited to announce the release of Apricity OS 11.2015 Beta. This release brings some notable improvements including a potential fix for some USB-writing bugs, a brand new terminal prompt, a bugfix for some Firefox installations, more Nvidia improvements, more Bluetooth bugfixes, and a permissions fix. We hope this release will be intuitive and enjoyable to use, and look forward to the fast-approaching KDE edition of Apricity OS.

Sincerely,

The Apricity OS Team
