The Apricity OS Team is happy to announce the release of Apricity OS 09.2015 Beta. This release brings several improvements, including improved automated hardware configuration, support for a greater range of hardware, improved default dock functionality, support for Firefox in ICE, improved UEFI support, Google Chrome 45--bringing a much needed decrease in system resource usage, support for transparency in terminal window backgrounds, improved filesystem permissions, smaller default desktop icons, and several other bugfixes. As usual, we hope you will find this release easy and enjoyable to use.

Sincerely,

The Apricity OS Team
