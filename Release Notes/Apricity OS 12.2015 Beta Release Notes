We're very happy to announce the release of Apricity OS 12.2015 Beta, just in time for the holidays. We had hoped to release our very first KDE edition, but alas it won't be ready until next month. Write a quick comment if you'd like to see an XFCE version before the KDE one, or if you have any other suggestions. With this release, we've fixed several bugs relating to package management, and have included a preconfigured Vim with the system. Additionally, we've upgraded Calamares, the installer, to version 2.0 Beta2, the latest relatively stable version. As always, we hope you'll enjoy this release.

Sincerely,

The Apricity OS Team
